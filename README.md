# Carbon-Footprint

This project is a front-end application designed to help individuals become more aware of their daily carbon emissions. Users can select or input activities like driving, meat consumption, and electricity use, and see how those choices contribute to their overall COâ‚‚ output. The app features visual summaries, activity filtering by category, and persistent data storage using localStorage.

### Functionality
-  Select or input daily activities (e.g., car travel, meat consumption, electricity use)
-  Automatically assign a CO2 value to each activity
-  View a running total of emissions
-  Display a visual summary (e.g., a bar or pie chart)
-  Filter activities by category (e.g., food, transport, energy)
-  Use localStorage to save data between sessions 

### Tech Stack :
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
